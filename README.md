# UFOs

## Overview
Dana has asked for our help with her webpage and dynamic table. She would like to make it more user friendly by providing the ability of of more in depth analysis'. In doing so users would be able to filter for mulitple criteria at the same time. Users could get specific down to the city, state, country and shape of the UFO.

Users are now able to search for sightings in specific areas on certain dates. The webpage also provides comments about each sighting. Thats helpful because you can compare notes and find similar experiences amongst different sightings. 


## Results

The Webpage works as Dana intends it to, if she wanted to take it a step further we could create a filter for the comments. In doing so users can find connections that way instead of having to do a seperate search after they find commonality.
